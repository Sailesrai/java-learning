 * 
 * ---Constructor-----
 *  # Used to create object in java.
 *  # special type of method which has same name as class name is called constructor.
 *  # does not have return type.
 *  # if there is no any user defined constructor in class .
      java provides default constructor to create object.
    # it returns object.  
      
 *  # Types:
 *    1) Default COnstructor
 *    # used to create object and set default values to it
 *    
 *    syntax:
 *         class_name(){
 *                 //set default values to object
 *         }
 *    
 *    2) Parameterized Constructor
 *    # use to create object and set dynamic values to it.
 *    
 *    #syntax:
 *        class_name(arg1,arg2,...,argn){
 *       //Set dynamic values to object
 *    }
 *    
 *    
 *    
 *    Instance variable is variable with object
 *    
 *    'This' keyowrd is used to remove ambiguity
 *    
 *     combine used is other
 *     instance is one use only for one person
 *     
 *     We can create multiple constructor in class is called overloading, so multiple types of objects are created
