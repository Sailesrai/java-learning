	 *   ------ Class & Object---------
	 *   Real world things represent class such as Car and object as Mercedes.
	 *   # Use to represent real world entity/Things.
	 *   # Class contains properties and methods - responsibilities
	 *   # It's a blueprint or templates of object.
	 *   # Class is a collection /group of object having similar behaviors.
	 *   # Class is a user defined or reference data type.        
	 *  
	 *   
	 *   Syntax: 
	 *   
	 *      class class_name{
	 *      
	 *      //Properties
	 *      
	 *      //Methods
	 *      
	 *      }
	 *      
	 *  ----------------object-------------
	 *  # implementation of class
	 *  # instance of class or ViceVersa
	 *  # Object contains instance variables and instance methods.
	 *  # Object allocates memory when it gets created.
	 *  
	 *  Syntax :
	 *   
	 *    Class_name obj_name = new class_name();
	 *    
	 *          or
	 *    
	 *    new class_name();
	 *
