	 * ---------Inheritance-----------
	 * 
	 *  # use for code re-usability
	 *  # process of accessing properties and methods of parent or super or base class 
	 *     to child or sub or derived class is known as inheritance.
	 * 
	 *  # also known as IS-A relationship
	 *  # Its a generalization to specialization process.
	 *  # we can inherit only one class at a time.
	 *  # we cannot inherit private variables, methods & constructor
	 *  # 'extends' Keyword is used for inheritance.
	 *  # we can't inherit final class
	 *     #Syntax
	 *      
	 *       child_class extends parent_class {
	 *       
	 *       //properties : parent + child
	 *       
	 *       //methods : parent + child
	 *       
	 *       }
	 *       
	 *       eg : 
	 *       
	 *       class A{
	 *       
	 *       }
	 *       class B extends A{
	 *       
	 *       }
	 *       
	 *     Types :
	 *      a> Single
	 *      b> Multiple
	 *      c> Hierachial
	 *       
	 *       polymorphism :- multiple form
	 *       
	 *     Method /Constructor  overloading is having multiple number of Method with different parameter.
	 *     we used to get multiple uses .
